<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging Permission Issues**

I've been focusing on the "Permission denied" error when running `npm run dev`. It seems this is occurring in a Linux environment after file transfer from a Windows system. My initial thoughts are leaning towards file permissions discrepancies being the root cause. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact permissions that require adjustment, particularly related to executable flags. I'm exploring common solutions for dealing with this, such as using `chmod` to modify file access, and considering other relevant environment configurations.


**Troubleshooting Permission Discrepancies**

I've been thinking about the permission issue in more detail. Specifically, `vite` doesn't have execute permission after a file transfer from Windows. The shift to a *nix environment shows that Windows and Linux have different permission models. The executable bit is often lost. I'm considering using `chmod +x` to add the execute permission to scripts in `node_modules/.bin/`, as a fix.


**Understanding Permission Differences**

I've been examining the different permission models between Windows and Linux to clarify the issue. The crux of the problem lies in how executable flags are handled during the file transfer. I now see the root cause: the discrepancies in Windows and Linux file permission schemes. When files are copied, the execute bit necessary for Linux scripts gets lost. The current focus is on understanding the nuances of how the 'chmod' command can rectify this, specifically with `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*`.


**Analyzing Permission Errors**

I've been working on a more comprehensive explanation for the user. I've broken down why the "Permission denied" error occurs, specifically highlighting the differences in file permission models between Windows and Linux. The core issue is the loss of the execute bit during file transfers. I've determined that `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*` is the most straightforward solution and can confirm that if the user runs `npm install`, the executable bit should be applied, however since the user's `node_modules` is clearly present, I am suggesting the former. I'll focus on ensuring the user fully understands this.


**Explaining and Offering Solutions**

I've been breaking down the issue with the "Permission denied" error, concentrating on its core root. Windows and Linux handle file permissions differently, resulting in executable flags getting lost during transfer. My analysis shows that `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*` is the simplest fix. I will advise this user that this is likely the solution and should be done on a project-level when copying project files.


**Explaining the Root Cause**

I've been examining the user's situation in greater detail, focusing on providing a comprehensive yet accessible explanation of the issue. I've formulated a response that acknowledges their specific problem and provides the `chmod` solution. I'm structuring my response to educate the user about the underlying cause—the differences between Windows and Linux file permissions—while offering a clear, actionable fix that should resolve their immediate problem. I'll emphasize the practicality of this solution within the context of their development environment.


**Understanding Permission Discrepancies**

I've crafted a comprehensive explanation for the user, addressing the "Permission denied" error following the Windows to Linux file transfer. It emphasizes the fundamental differences in Windows and Linux permission systems that cause this issue. The solution: `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*` should add the necessary execute permissions, and if it doesn't work, I'll suggest a `npm install`.


**Providing Solutions for the Issue**

I've been formulating a comprehensive response to the user's issue, covering both the root cause and the solutions. I'm focusing on clearly explaining the permission discrepancies between Windows and Linux systems. My goal is to equip the user with actionable steps, including the `chmod +x` command for a quick fix and the `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` approach for a more thorough resolution. I aim to ensure they fully understand the problem and are confident in resolving it.

I'll provide both an explanation of the underlying cause—the differences in file permission models—and actionable solutions, including both a quick `chmod` fix and a more thorough reinstall approach. I'm focusing on clarity and practicality to ensure the user can resolve the issue effectively.


**Resolving File Permission Issues**

I'm now putting together the complete response for the user's issue, covering both the root cause and the suggested solutions. I'll clearly explain the Windows-to-Linux file permission discrepancies, and offer the `chmod +x` command for a quick fix, along with a `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` approach for a more complete resolution. I'm focusing on providing practical solutions to ensure the user can fix the problem.

Of course. It's a classic issue when you move a project from a Windows to a Linux-based environment (like WSL). Here's an explanation of what's happening and how to fix it.

### Why is this happening?

This problem comes down to the fundamental differences in how Windows and Linux handle file permissions.

*   **Linux/Unix-like systems** use a permission model with "read," "write," and "execute" bits for the file owner, group, and others. For a script or program to run, it *must* have the execute bit set.
*   **Windows** uses a different system based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) and doesn't have the same concept of an "execute" bit. File extensions like `.exe`, `.com`, or `.bat` often determine if a file is executable.

When you copy files from Windows to Linux, the execute permission bit is often not set on the files. The error `sh: 1: vite: Permission denied` is telling you that the shell (`sh`) tried to run the `vite` command but was denied by the operating system because the `vite` script file doesn't have execute permissions.

### How to fix it

You have a couple of options to resolve this.

#### Option 1: The Quick Fix (Recommended)

You can manually add the execute permission to the scripts that `npm` uses. The `vite` script, along with others from your project's dependencies, lives in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

Run the following command from your `PepayCommerce` project root:

```bash
chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*
```

This command tells Linux to add (`+`) execute (`x`) permissions to all files (`*`) inside the `node_modules/.bin/` directory. After running this, try `npm run dev` again. It should work now.

#### Option 2: The "Nuke and Pave" Fix

If you want to be absolutely sure that all permissions are set correctly according to how the package manager would set them up on a Linux system, you can delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your dependencies.

1.  **Remove the existing `node_modules` directory:**
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    ```

2.  **Reinstall your packages:**
    Since you ran `npm run dev`, you should use `npm` to install.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    I see you also have a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, so if you typically use `pnpm` as your package manager, you should use this command instead:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

This method takes a bit longer but ensures a clean state for all your project's dependencies in your new Linux environment.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing a New Error**

I've hit a new snag after resolving the initial permissions problem. It's a `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu` error. It seems like it's linked to a known npm bug around optional dependencies. I'm exploring potential workarounds, specifically the suggested `npm i` command, to see if it clears the path.


**Resolving the Dependency Issue**

I'm now zeroing in on this missing `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu` module. The error pinpoints a known npm bug with optional dependencies. After some consideration, I believe the `npm i` command after removing `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` is the most direct path forward. This aligns well with my intuition and prior recommendations. I'm hopeful this will swiftly clear the path!


**Formulating a Plan**

I'm now fully immersed in the missing Rollup module conundrum. It seems a platform switch led to the absence of the correct native binary. I've outlined a direct course of action: first, I'll recommend the "nuke and pave" approach with `npm` commands, including removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, followed by `npm install`. This should refresh the dependencies. Then, I'll mention the option to use `pnpm` instead. I'll stick to recommending `npm` since that seems to be the current tool of choice.


**Clarifying the Root Cause**

I've got the root of the problem pinned down now. It's a missing Rollup binary specific to Linux, triggered by an OS shift. The presence of both `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now a key point, and it's best to stick to one package manager. I'll outline clear steps for both `npm` and `pnpm`, with an explanation, aiming for a smooth resolution.

You've run into another classic cross-platform issue! This error is happening because some of your project's dependencies (specifically `rollup`, which is used by `vite`) need to install packages that are specific to your operating system.

### Why is this happening?

When you originally ran `npm install` on Windows, it downloaded the Windows-specific version of `rollup`. Now that you're on Linux (WSL), the code is looking for the Linux version (`@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`), but it can't find it because it was never installed.

The error message itself points to the best solution:
`Please try \`npm i\` again after removing both package-lock.json and node_modules directory.`

This is the "Nuke and Pave" approach I mentioned earlier, and it's the correct way to fix this kind of dependency conflict.

### How to fix it

You need to perform a clean re-installation of your project's dependencies. This will force `npm` to detect that you're on Linux and download the correct versions of all packages.

Here are the steps. Run these commands from your `PepayCommerce` directory:

1.  **Remove the `node_modules` directory:**
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    ```

2.  **Remove the `package-lock.json` file:** This file contains a "lock" on the Windows-specific versions, so it's important to delete it.
    ```bash
    rm package-lock.json
    ```

3.  **Re-install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

After the installation is complete, everything should be configured for your Linux environment. You can now start your development server again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should resolve the error and get your project running.

**A quick note:** I see you have both a `package-lock.json` and a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in your project. This suggests you may have used both `npm` and `pnpm` at different times. It's best practice to stick with a single package manager for a project to avoid dependency conflicts. Since you're using `npm run dev`, the instructions above for `npm` are the right ones to follow.
